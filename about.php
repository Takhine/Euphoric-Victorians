          <p class="text-justify">At <b class="fz-18">Euphoric Victorians</b>, we begin our journey at the roots of education, that is, at “Educere” and “Educatum”. We lead out, raise and educate while training the system from within. Euphoric Victorians is a platform aimed at bridging the gap between quality and education. </p>
          <p class="text-justify">With a rising need to upskill and orient the preachers of knowledge, we apply the naturalist and pragmatist concept of purely activity based learning that helps the learners grow using natural instincts. We consider the classroom as a Social-Subsystem for continuous learning, and work towards keeping the learning process effective and efficient.
